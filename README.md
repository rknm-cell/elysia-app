## Lecture Code

## Overview

You will implement (3x) email/password authentication using firebase, Cookies and JWT, and Clerk. Additionally, you'll create authenticated API endpoints using the Vercel AI SDK (or similar) and document them with OpenAPI specifications.
[Please read the Copenhagen book.](https://thecopenhagenbook.com/)

## Core Concepts

- username / password
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens)  
- Cookies 
- Better Auth
- API Development & Documentation
- Protected API Endpoints  
- OpenAPI/Swagger Specifications

## Features

Build an express app (or other simple TS server) that implements the following:

- Request Middleware
- Client-Side Log In, Log Out, Sign Up HTML pages
- Authenticated API endpoints
- hosted OpenAPI documentation
- use an Auth library for ["Better Auth"](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/integrations/elysia)

## Step-by-Step Process

This assignment builds a **single application** that you'll develop incrementally. Each step introduces new concepts by letting you discover why they're needed.

### Step 1: Create the Basic App Structure
- [x] Set up Express (or Elysia) server
- [x] Create two endpoints:
  - [x] `GET /api/public` - Returns: `{ message: "This is public information" }`
  - [x] `GET /api/protected` - Returns: `{ message: "Only admin should be able to see this" }`
- [x] **Problem**: Both endpoints are actually public! Anyone can access the "protected" one.

### Step 2: Add API Documentation
- [x] Add Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for both endpoints
- [x] Serve interactive docs at `/api-docs`
- [x] Document request/response schemas
- [x] Test both endpoints through Swagger UI

### Step 3: Create User System
- [x] Create an in-memory list of users with different roles:
  ```javascript
  const users = [
    { id: 1, username: "admin", password: "admin123", role: "admin" },
    { id: 2, username: "user", password: "user123", role: "basic" }
  ];
  ```
- [x] **Problem**: How do we know which user is making the request to `/api/protected`?

### Step 4: Add Authentication Middleware (First Attempt)
- [x] Create middleware that checks if user is admin
- [x] Apply it to the protected endpoint
- [x] **Problem**: There's no way to identify the user from the request! We need some way to know who they are.

### Step 5: Introduce User Secrets
- [x] Give each user a unique SECRET:
  ```javascript
  const users = [
    { id: 1, username: "admin", password: "admin123", role: "admin", secret: "admin-secret-123" },
    { id: 2, username: "user", password: "user123", role: "basic", secret: "user-secret-456" }
  ];
  ```
- [x] Update middleware to check for secret in:
  - [x] `Authorization` header: `Bearer admin-secret-123`
  - [x] OR Cookie: `secret=admin-secret-123`
- [x] Find user by secret, check if role is "admin"
- [x] **Success**: Now the protected endpoint actually works!

### Step 6: Realize the Problems with Secrets
Discuss these security issues:
1. **Interception**: Anyone who sees the network request gets the secret
2. **Theft**: Malicious browser extensions can steal cookies
3. **No Expiry**: Secrets never expire - if stolen, they work forever
4. **No Rotation**: Can't easily change secrets without breaking everything

**Solution**: We need something that can expire and be renewed automatically â†’ **JWT Tokens**

### Step 7: Learn About JWTs
- [x] Read about JWT structure (header.payload.signature)
- [x] Understand signing vs verification
- [x] Learn about expiry (`exp` claim)
- [x] Practice signing and decoding JWTs manually

### Step 8: Implement JWT System
- [x] Install JWT library (`jsonwebtoken` or `jose`)
- [x] Create functions to:
  - [x] Sign JWTs with user info and expiration
  - [x] Verify and decode JWTs
  - [ ] Handle expired tokens

### Step 9: Create Login Endpoint
- [ ] `POST /api/login` - Takes username/password
  - [ ] Verify credentials against user list
  - [ ] Sign JWT with user ID and role
  - [ ] Set JWT in cookie AND return it in response
  - [ ] Document in Swagger with examples

### Step 10: Update Authentication Middleware
- [ ] Modify middleware to:
  - [ ] Extract JWT from Authorization header OR cookie
  - [ ] Verify JWT signature
  - [ ] Decode user info from JWT
  - [ ] Check if user role is "admin"
  - [ ] Handle expired tokens gracefully

### Step 11: Add More Protected Endpoints
- [ ] `POST /api/chat` - AI chat (requires any authenticated user)
- [ ] `GET /api/chat/history` - Chat history (requires authentication)
- [ ] `DELETE /api/chat/history` - Clear history (requires authentication)
- [ ] Update Swagger with authentication schemes

### Step 12: Test the Full Flow
- [ ] Use Swagger UI to:
  - [ ] Try accessing protected endpoints (should fail)
  - [ ] Login via `/api/login` endpoint
  - [ ] Use returned JWT in "Authorize" button
  - [ ] Access protected endpoints (should work)

### Step 13: Professional Implementation with Better Auth
- [ ] Replace your custom system with [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/)
- [ ] Implement proper user database
- [ ] Add features like password hashing, email verification, etc.
- [ ] Keep your existing API endpoints but use Better Auth for authentication

### Step 14: Add real API endpoints for querying an AI app that you are building:

All of these endpoints must require valid authentication:
- [ ] `POST /api/chat` - AI chat completion using Vercel AI SDK
  - [ ] Accept messages in OpenAI format
  - [ ] Return streaming or non-streaming responses
  - [ ] Require authentication token/session
- [ ] `GET /api/chat/history` - Retrieve user's chat history
  - [ ] Return paginated chat history for authenticated user
- [ ] `DELETE /api/chat/history` - Clear user's chat history
  - [ ] Only allow users to delete their own history
- [ ] `GET /api/profile` - Get authenticated user profile
- [ ] `PUT /api/profile` - Update authenticated user profile


### API Development Requirements

Choose ONE of the following approaches for your API development:

#### Option A: Express + OpenAPI (Traditional)
- [ ] Implement AI chat API using Vercel AI SDK with Express
- [ ] Create OpenAPI 3.0 specification using `swagger-jsdoc` and `swagger-ui-express`
- [ ] Add request/response validation using `zod` or `joi`
- [ ] Document all endpoints with proper schemas

#### Option B: Elysia (Modern Alternative)
- [ ] Migrate to Elysia framework for better TypeScript support
- [ ] Implement AI chat API using Vercel AI SDK with Elysia
- [ ] Use Elysia's built-in OpenAPI generation with `@elysiajs/swagger`
- [ ] Leverage Elysia's type-safe validation system

### OpenAPI Specification Requirements
- [ ] Generate complete OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- [ ] Include authentication schemes in spec (Bearer token, Cookie, etc.)
- [ ] Document all request/response schemas
- [ ] Add example requests and responses
- [ ] Include error response documentation
- [ ] Serve interactive API documentation (Swagger UI)
- [ ] Export OpenAPI spec as JSON/YAML file

### Example API Implementation

#### Express + Vercel AI SDK Example:
```javascript
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { streamText } from 'ai';

app.post('/api/chat', authenticateToken, async (req, res) => {
  const { messages } = req.body;
  
  const result = await streamText({
    model: openai('gpt-4o'),
    messages,
  });

  return result.toDataStreamResponse();
});
```

#### Elysia + Vercel AI SDK Example:
```typescript
import { Elysia, t } from 'elysia'
import { swagger } from '@elysiajs/swagger'
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai'
import { streamText } from 'ai'

const app = new Elysia()
  .use(swagger())
  .post('/api/chat', async ({ body }) => {
    const result = await streamText({
      model: openai('gpt-4o'),
      messages: body.messages,
    });
    
    return result.toDataStreamResponse();
  }, {
    body: t.Object({
      messages: t.Array(t.Object({
        role: t.String(),
        content: t.String()
      }))
    }),
    beforeHandle: authenticateUser
  })
```

Bonus:
- [ ] Add OAuth provider (sign in with Google, Github)  
- [ ] Add magic-link sign in
- [ ] Rate limiting for API endpoints
- [ ] Load and edit an authentication-gated user profile  
      - [ ] Eg. I can change my name if I'm logged in  
- [ ] Serve a React App with the correct authentication cookies, and build a custom UI for your app using React.

## Framework Decision

You may choose between:
1. **Express** (traditional, more setup required for OpenAPI)
2. **Elysia** (modern, built-in TypeScript + OpenAPI support)

If you choose Express, you'll need additional packages for OpenAPI:
- `swagger-jsdoc` for generating OpenAPI from JSDoc comments
- `swagger-ui-express` for serving documentation
- `zod` or `joi` for validation

If you choose Elysia, you get:
- Built-in TypeScript support
- Native OpenAPI generation
- Built-in validation
- Better performance
- Modern development experience
